the goal is not to find a "perfect" dataset or porject, but just to get started and iterate from there.

iterate from end to end in your project; that is, don't spend months fine-tunning your model, or polishing the perfect GUI, or labeling the perfect dataset... Instead, complete every step as well as you can in a reasonable amount of time, all the way to the end.
By completing the project end to end, you will se where the trickiest bits are, and which bits make the biggest difference to the final result.

data augmentation: synthetically generated variations of input images, such as by rotating them or changin their brightness and contrast; it also works well for text and other types of models.

Another point to consider is that although your problem might not look like a computer vision problem, it might be possible with a little imagination to turn it into one.

at the time of writing, Bing Image Search is the best option we now of for finding and downloading images.It's free up to 150 images.
important: Keep in Touch with the latest services: services that can be used for creating datasets come and go all the time and their features, interfaces and pricing change regularly too.

here is how to use the search images bing function in utlils notebook
```
results = search_image_bing(key, term, min_sz=128, max_images=150)
ims = results.attrgot('contentUrl')
print(len(ims))	# 150

# download image
dest = 'images/grizzly.jpg'
download_url(ims[0], dest)

# open image
im = Image.open(dest)
